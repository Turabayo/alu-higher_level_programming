WHAT IS IT ABOUT
================



This is a function that will divided all elements of a matrix by a div number which we will pass

into our function



HOW IT WORKS

============



We will pass a matrix that we want to get its elemets divided and a div which is a divisor

that we want our elements to be divided by



::



	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

	>>> matrix = [
		 [1, 2, 3],
		 [4, 5, 6]
		]

	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
		[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]


::

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[4, 6, 2],
	...	[8, 6, 4]
	... ]

	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
	[[2, 3, 1], [4, 3, 2]]



If we have floats in our matrix, it will alsoo work as expected

::

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[4.4, 2.2, 6.6],
	...	[6.4, 4.8, 2.4]
	... ]

	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
	[[2.2, 1.1, 3.3], [3.2, 2.4, 1.2]]

If our matrix is not a list of lists

::

	>>> matrix = "not a list of lists"
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers or floats

An empty list will give an error

::

	>>> matrix = []
	print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	TRaceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers or floats

If a matrix is a list of empty list, it will work

===

	>>> matrix = [[]]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	[[]]

All lists in matrix must have the same number of elements, otherwise, an error will be gotten

===

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[2, 3, 4, 5],
	...	[1, 2, 3]
	... ]
	
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

If in our lists we have an element which is not an int or a float, a TypeError will be gotten

===

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[1, 2, 3],
	...	['non_num', 2, 3]
	... ]

	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 4))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats


If DIV is not an int or a float
===============================

::

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[1, 2, 3],
	...	[2, 3, 4]
	... ]

	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 'non_num'))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: div must be a number


If div == 0, a ZeroDivisionError will be encountered

::

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[1, 2, 3],
	...	[4, 5, 6]
	... ]

	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
	ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
