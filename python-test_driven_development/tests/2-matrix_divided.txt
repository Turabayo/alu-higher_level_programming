WHAT IS IT ABOUT
================

This is a function that will divided all elements of a matrix by a div number which we will pass
into our function

HOW IT WORKS
============

We will pass a matrix that we want to get its elemets divided and a div which is a divisor
that we want our elements to be divided by

::

	>>>#!/usr/bin/python3

matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided



matrix = [
	 [1, 2, 3],
	 [4, 5, 6]
]

print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))

print(matrix)
